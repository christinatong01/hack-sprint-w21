### Stack navigator analogy
A stack navigator is much like a stack of books. We can add a book to the top of our stack and also remove that book. These actions are just like navigating to a new active screen and then going back to the original screen by closing the active screen. Another way to think about this is with the stack data structure. 

### Important functions
